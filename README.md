==========

Helper code for using OpenCV and Libsvm for machine learning in Processing. Created for [MAS.S62 Interactive Machine Learning](http://iml.media.mit.edu/).

Examples depend on [OpenCV for Processing](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing) and [Processing-SVM](https://github.com/atduskgreg/Processing-SVM), a libsvm wrapper.

### Examples

* **hog_recogntion** Demonstrates hand gesture recognition with Histogram of Oriented Gradients
